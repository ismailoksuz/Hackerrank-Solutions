Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges 
created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same 
number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less 
than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

Input Format
The following tables contain challenge data:
Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.
+---------+-------+
|Column   |Type   |
+---------+-------+
|hacker_id|Integer|	
|name     |String |
+---------+-------+

Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, the hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the challenge, 
and difficulty_level is the level of difficulty of the challenge.
+------------+-------+
|Column      |Type   |
+------------+-------+
|challange_id|Integer|	
|hacker_id   |Integer|
+------------+-------+
