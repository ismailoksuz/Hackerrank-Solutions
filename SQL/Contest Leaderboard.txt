You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, 
and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the 
result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

Input Format
The following tables contain contest data:
Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.
+---------+-------+
|Column   |Type   |
+---------+-------+
|hacker_id|Integer|	
|name     |String |
+---------+-------+

Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id is 
the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission. 
+--------------+-------+
|Column        |Type   |

|submmission_id|Integer|	
|hacker_id     |Integer|
|challenge_id  |Integer|
|score	       |Integer|

Select h.hacker_id,h.name,SUM(s2s)
From Hackers h inner join (Select hacker_id,MAX(score) as s2s 
                           From Submissions 
                           Group by hacker_id,challenge_id) s2 
                           on h.hacker_id=s2.hacker_id
Group by h.hacker_id,h.name
Having SUM(s2s)>0
Order by SUM(s2s) desc,h.hacker_id
