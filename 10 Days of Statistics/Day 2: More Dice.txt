Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem.

Task
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

Solution
We have 36 different options which comes from 6*6.
Dices' sum can be max 12 (6,6) min 2 (1,1)
Satisfied conditions are:
1-5
2-4
4-2
1-5
So 4 conditions satisfies the result.
4/36 = 1/9
