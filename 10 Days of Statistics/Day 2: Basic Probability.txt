Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for a breakdown of probability fundamentals!

Task
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

Solution
We have 36 different options which comes from 6*6.
Dices' sum can be max 12 (6,6) min 2 (1,1)
6-6, 6-5, 6-4, 5-6, 5-5, 4-6 are the probabilities that are higher than 9 in sum
So in 36-6=30 outcomes, it provides the condition.
30/36 = 5/6
