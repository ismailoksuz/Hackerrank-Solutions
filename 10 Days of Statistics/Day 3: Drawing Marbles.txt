Objective
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.

Task
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Solution
We got 7 marbles.
After drawing 1 marble, there is 6 marbles exist.
We know that the drawn marble is red so there is still 3-1=2 red marbles exist.
And we got 4 blue marbles in the bag.
So 4/6 = 2/3 is the answer.
