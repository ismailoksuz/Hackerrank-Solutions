Objective
In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Solution
(1/2) is the probability for gender whether girl or boy
As they have 2 children, (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 probabilities exist
All probabilities are:
BB
BG
GB
GG
Question gives us that one of the children are boy, so we ignore the GG probability
We want the find the probability when both children are boys which is BB
(BB)/(BB, BG, GB) => 1/3
